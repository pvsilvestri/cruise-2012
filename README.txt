2012 10th Anniversary Drupal 6 Theme
Project lead: Paul Silvestri <paul@paulsilvestri.com>

This theme was adapted from early versions of the Basic theme developed by Raincity Studios found at http://drupal.org/project/basic

Since that time, these two themes have diverged widely, as new features have been added to Basic, while different functionality has been added to this theme.

Holy Grail Layout

The layout used in Basic, like in Zen, is the Holy Grail method. You can have a detailed information about this method here :
http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail

The purpose of this method is to have a minimal markup for an ideal display.

For accessibility and search engine optimization, the best order to display a page is the following :

	1. header
	2. content
	3. sidebars
	4. footer

This is how the page template is buit in Basic, and it works in fluid and fixed layout.
